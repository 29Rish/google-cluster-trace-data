# Data Download Instructions

The data is stored in Google Storage for Developers. Each trace uses its own bucket. In this example, we will use the `v2.1` trace from 2011, called `clusterdata-2011-2`. You do not need to have a Google account or sign up for Google Storage to download the data.

## Methods to Download Data

### 1. **Using GSUtil (Recommended)**

#### Step 1: Install GSUtil
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Install `gsutil` by following the official instructions:
   - If you have **Python** installed, you can install `gsutil` via `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install gsutil
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can install **Google Cloud SDK**, which includes `gsutil`:
     ```bash
     curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
     exec -l $SHELL
     gcloud init
     ```

#### Step 2: Verify Installation
Run the following command to check if `gsutil` is installed correctly:
```bash
gsutil version
```

#### Step 3: List Files in the Storage Bucket
To see what files are available in the storage bucket, use:
```bash
gsutil ls gs://clusterdata-2011-2/
```

#### Step 4: Download the Data
- To download **all files** from the bucket to a local directory (e.g., `./data/`):
  ```bash
  gsutil -m cp -R gs://clusterdata-2011-2/ ./data/
  ```
  The `-m` flag enables parallel downloading for better performance.

- To download **specific files** (e.g., only task usage files):
  ```bash
  gsutil -m cp -R gs://clusterdata-2011-2/task_usage/ ./data/task_usage/
  ```

#### Step 5: Verify Integrity of the Download
- Download the `SHA256SUM` file:
  ```bash
  gsutil cp gs://clusterdata-2011-2/SHA256SUM ./data/
  ```
- Check file integrity:
  ```bash
  cd ./data
  sha256sum --check SHA256SUM
  ```

---

## Notes
- The data is derived from monitoring data, and there may be some missing entries due to overloads or bugs.
- If the download is interrupted, `gsutil` will resume from where it left off when you attempt to download again.

For additional information, refer to the official Google Cloud documentation on [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil).

This format should be perfect for inclusion in a GitHub repository's `README.md` file. Let me know if you'd like any additional changes!
